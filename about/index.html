			<p>Hey, there.ðŸ¥³ My name is Yungang Zhu. You can also call me Leo. This page was written on September 29th, 2022. At that time, I have graduated from SCAU for just one year, and worked as a web crawler engineer in GuangZhou, Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>Actually, I have come up with this idea of writing my personal blog very long before, and at first, I want this blog to be a knowledge base to record what I learned in work and study. However, it was abandoned after I wrote two passages. I clearly remember that one of these two articles was talking about the &ldquo;String in Python&rdquo; and another was the records about my cats (I have held two, quite cute. Maybe you can see them in future articles).</p>
<p>For reasons I left the previous blog, perhaps my lazyness mainly needs to be blamed ðŸ¤ª, and also, taking notes in my blog, especially <strong>study notes</strong>, is quite painful for me. It always makes me feel like taking notes in the school lessons although there aren&rsquo;t any teachers talking in front of me ðŸ˜‚. I believed that more practices are more useful for me.</p>
<p>Thus, this blog will be filled with what I truly wanna write down, anything, anytime, anywhere, and with my two cats, riding my bike.</p>
